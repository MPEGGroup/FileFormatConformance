The \u2018prgr\u2019 entity group and the \u2018prdi\u2019 item property indicate to a player that when realizing a progressive rendering of the grid, two intermediate reconstructions are of particular interest: a first preview of the primary item (the grid image item) using the thumbnail and an intermediate reconstruction (as shown on Figure 2) of the grid where the most interesting areas are displayed in high quality.",
